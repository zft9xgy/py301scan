# py301scan

The `py301scan` project aims to help users manage and rectify URLs on large or multilingual websites. It assists in extracting all URLs from a website, identifying those with 301 redirects, and subsequently locating these URLs in the original list to facilitate their correction.

> **Notice:**
> The project is still very new and may have some bugs, I would greatly appreciate if you could add an issue or contact me by email zft9xgy@proton.me if you find any bugs, errors or would like to add new features.
